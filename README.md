# Orochi DB

Lightweight, embeddable key-value / document store (work in progress).

## Status

- Initial scaffolding only. Features, design and API are TBD.

## Goals

- Small and embeddable
- Simple HTTP/CLI tooling
- ACID-like semantics where practical

## Getting started

This repository is currently empty. To initialize locally:

```sh
# create a new local repo with main branch
git init -b main
# add README and make initial commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: add README"
# add remote and push
git remote add origin git@github.com:jbeck018/orochi-db.git
git push -u origin main
```

If your Git is older and `git init -b` isn't supported:
```sh
git init
git checkout -b main
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Open issues for proposals and RFCs before large changes.

## License

TBD
